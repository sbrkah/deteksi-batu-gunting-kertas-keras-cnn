The rock-paper-scissors machine learning model repository description can be structured as follows:

## Project Title
- Rock-Paper-Scissors Machine Learning Model
- This repository contains a machine learning model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning to recognize hand gestures for the game of rock-paper-scissors.

### Model
- The model is based on CNN and transfer learning, utilizing frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. It is trained on a dataset consisting of images of rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures.

### Usage
- The model can be used to play rock-paper-scissors interactively, where the user's hand gesture is recognized by the model.

### Repository Contents
- The repository includes the trained model weights, Jupyter notebook for model training, and deployment scripts for running the model as a web application.
